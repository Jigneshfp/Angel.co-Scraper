# Angel.co-Scraper
An attempt to scrape angel.co
This was a task given under an internship selection process
Angel.co has very strict policy on web crawling robots which made web
scraping a really challenging task
it has an impressive backend weblog analysis server which blocks the ip within 7-8 pages of consecutive page requests patterns
it banned my original IP address due to abnormal activity in the phase
of testing my code
and hence i had to use proxies each with different user-agents to keep
targeting the web pages until it gives access to the data
this is by no means used to harm the website
