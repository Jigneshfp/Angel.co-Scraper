# Angel.co-Scraper
An attempt to scrape angel.co<br>
Angel.co has very strict policy on web crawling robots which made web<br>
scraping a really challenging task<br>
it has an impressive backend weblog analysis server which blocks the ip within 7-8 pages of consecutive page requests patterns<br>
it banned my original IP address due to abnormal activity in the phase<br>
of testing my code<br>
and hence i had to use proxies each with different user-agents to keep<br>
targeting the web pages until it gives access to the data<br>
this is by no means used to harm the website<br>
